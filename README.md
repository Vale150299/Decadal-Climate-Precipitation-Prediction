# Decadal Prediction of African Precipitation Variability
Decadal Climate Predictions • Hybrid Statistical–Dynamical Forecasting • Mode Matching • NAO Matching Post-processing • ENSO-based subsampling • CNN Teleconnection Diagnostics


This repository will contain the code, data structure, and analysis workflow for my thesis:

**"Hybrid Statistical–Dynamical Methods for Decadal Prediction of African Precipitation Variability."**

The project explores and provides two Mode Matching methodologies:
- To improve decadal precipitation skill across the domain 
- To better understand the impact of the teleconnections involved

- Boreal Winter (DJFM): NAO matching; selecting members based on their ability to reproduce NAO
- Boreal Summer (JJAS): ENSO Based Subsampling; selecting members based on their ability to reproduce ENSO
